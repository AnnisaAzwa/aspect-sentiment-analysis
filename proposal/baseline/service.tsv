 This is the third time we stayed at this hotel It is simply great Perfect location and the staff is lovely Definitely recommend it to anyone who is visiting Paris This time I was traveling as family and they gave us a lovely family room on the 7th floor The view was absolutely superb 	1
 Bath towels are the size of a face towel For an American Hotel I would have thought that they would have had bath towels fits for the average American I am not American who are rather larger than the average European.  Location Good for the RER B for both airports  	-1
 The hotel was in a brilliant location The staff were very nice and welcoming and the rooms were quite comfortable and cosy Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Paris 	1
 Location very quiet street but only a stone throw away from bars and restaurants Nice modern room Very clean Friendly and helpful reception staff who all spoke excellent English	1
 Location was just excellent Staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for Paris really Very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting Paris again 	1
 Not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore.  Fantastic hotel near the Sorbonne on the Paris left bank Close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone Our room was a decent size and very comfortable The hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated Our room faced the street but at night it was quiet There are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff 	1
 Excellent location and comfortable hotel Very pleasant staff 5 6 minutes walk to Isle de la Cite and about 6 7 walk to the metro Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby  The housekeeping was a little flaky Face towel disappeared and never returned Milk wasn t topped up Room was small but Parisian hotels usually are Double glazing would be good despite being on 7th floor there was noticeable street noise We had a really good deal on the price I do not know if I would have been so happy paying full price 	-1
 Good location.  I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper 	1
 No shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers.   Beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested	1
 Well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window We like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in Paris.  We had requested a quiet room The room we had 404 was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors It meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants Luckily they were not too noisy people It should not have been allocated to us If they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space 	-1
 Beautiful hotel with large stylish rooms Super fast service at reception Been stopped by the door man and asked to produce our room keys to prove we were stopping there Stereotyping due to tattoos 	1
 The brochure in the room stated breakfast until noon However it finished at 11 so we missed out It cost a lot more to have breakfast included on the room rate so was not happy 	-1
  Not enough coffee in our room only 3 packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup The coffee supplied at Breakfast the following morning was COLD and had no taste of coffee whatsoever This was our second visit and ALL was good	0
 The staff and the room were very good and we had a bowl of complimentary fruit We did not eat there other than a complimentary birthday cake which was brought to our room Jade on reception was very helpful	1
 The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use  I did not have time to use the hotel facilities for a one night stay however the bar service and staff in the lobby area was excellent 	1
 1 Bed quality is poor King size bed is simply 2 singles joined Pillow choice and mattress is poor 2 No free wifi 3 Room size not great for price  1 Excellent location walking distance to most places and tube bus stops nearby 2 Staff were helpful	1
 The hotel is excellent and in a great location All of the staff were very friendly and breakfast was very nice  I was disappointed with the Spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment We only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so 	1
 This hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel  The breakfast is very poor quality and the service terrible The food was like transport cafe food Dreadful quality And at 100 00 for 4 Shocking 	-1
 The rooms are lovely we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful as our stay was for my husbands 40th birthday This made it extra special  Our iron in the room didn t work Not a big deal but I would have like to run it over my dress before dinner 	0
 Amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect We even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary Thanks to all the staff 	1
