 Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it   The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park 	-1
 Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast   Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good	1
 Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too  	0
 Comfy bed good location   The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast 	0
 Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse  Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic 	-1
 Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area   Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit 	1
  Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning 	1
 Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all   The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around 	1
 Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective   Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern 	1
 the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that  The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam	0
 Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to   Fantastic location very clean room someone called Leanne I think on reception was helpful and kind Breakfast was lovely great choice 	-1
 Breakfast was excellent Staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table   Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night 	1
 The garden was a bonus Lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink Secure parking was also a good feature   The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good 	0
 The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv   Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area 	-1
 Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back   Location first and foremost Lovely gardens 	0
 quiet comfy room Very helpful staff Excellent location just off the Earls Court tube and lots of excellent places to eat close by   choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem 	1
 The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential  Closeness to Piccadilly Line and general ambience of the hotel	0
 Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples   The location was excellent 2 mins from tube and walkable to several locations Kensington Palace Albert Hall Knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile We received a complimentary upgrade on the room Bed was lovely and comfortable Hotel was lovely Staff friendly and attentive As is just off main road nice and quiet Can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need I always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes I would You ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why Lovely hotel for a special occasion 	1
 Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in   Location for tube and central London plus some nice restaurants close by too Staff were very pleasant Breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too 	1
 We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable   The location is definitely the main selling point	0
 Difficult to locate the phone to contact reception lack toilet itineraries and it was difficult to locate these   They have followed through special requests Comfortable bed wide choices for breakfast and very clean 	1
 Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal   We had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable	0
 No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food   Standard rooms are very comfortable Good central location 	0
 Very large room Hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful Short walk to public transport Blackfriars Tube Station and Temple Station  	0
 Location and room excellent  We have been charged for room service that we did not have I spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of 43 53 issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed This has not been done 	-1
 Every thing was excellent Apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at 9 am by staff walking in room When I mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered   Room was great Bathroom was immaculately clean	-1
  Room and bathroom excellent Really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower TV ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room Hotel looks new so all furnishings modern Tube a short walk away We walked to the Theatre district in around 15 20 minutes We did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by I would certainly recommend this hotel 	0
 Staff really friendly bed was extremely comfy and not too far from two underground stations The concierge recommended a great italian on fleet street and booked a table for two in minutes Overall great stay  	1
 we were very pleased with the Hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the Standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors  	0
 Nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area   The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while 	0
